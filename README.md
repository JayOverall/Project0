### Process

Used Javascript to build the functionality of the board, looking back Jquery would of been a welcome addition but managed to get it done with Java and didnt have time to go over and refine my DOM code with Jquery.

CSS works for now but needs some reshaping with borders its a bit all over the place.

I approached this Project with getting the fundamental board game working first then adding features later, which was a good approach however it made it extremly buggy trying to add new features later so if i was to start over i would map everything out alot more carefully. Because there was alot of broken code!!!!
